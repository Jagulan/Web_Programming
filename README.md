# Russel Street Medical Website Expansion

## Summary
As part of this project, I expanded and improved the website for Russel Street Medical by implementing dynamic features using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. The project included the creation of an administration page with login/logout capabilities, server-side validation for patient bookings, and a carousel gallery on the homepage. The application was hosted on Coreteaching servers, adhering to strict naming conventions, permissions, and password protection protocols. Additionally, I integrated reusable PHP functions for modularity and enhanced user experience with responsive design principles.
